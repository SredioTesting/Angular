# ng eject

## Overview
`ng eject` ejects your app and output the proper webpack configuration and scripts.

This command uses the same flags as `ng build`, generating webpack configuration to match those
flags.

You can use `--force` to overwrite existing configurations.
You can eject multiple times, to have a dev and prod config for instance, by renaming the ejected
configuration and using the `--force` flag.

### Ejecting the CLI

ng eject
```
