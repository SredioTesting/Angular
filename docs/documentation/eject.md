# ng eject

## Overview
Create a basic Webpack configuration for your app.

This command will create a basic webpack configuration and update your `angular.json` file to use it.

This configuration will include the necessary plugins and loader to build Angular applications.
You may need to edit this configuration to match more advanced build options that your project was using.

You can then build using this configuration via `ng run project-name:build-webpack`.

To build for production use `ng run project-name:build-webpack:production` instead.

To serve using Webpack Dev Server, use `ng run project-name:serve-webpack`.

## Options
None.
